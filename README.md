### KAFKA GUI
##### Just a simple application that can send and listen on topics

##### Setup
* you can configure (like a port config) by your own while placing a properties or yml file except kafka configs

##### Known issues
* its just a beta
* not thread safe
* consumer & producer is static and don't belong to the user
* listen on multiple topic and other non default actions causes errors
* dependency problems
* embedded kafka in test causes errors
